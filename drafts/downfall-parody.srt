338
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:13,300
Watch out, shillers!

339
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:22,300
Is that FartyCoin’s army?
- No, It’s OurCoin’s community.

340
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:25,900
But hasn’t StanCoin’s infiltration
of their Telegram started?

341
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:31,160
You must flood them with FUD faster!
We’re running out of time!

342
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,760
But you said you had
this all under control...

343
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:36,370
StanCoin’s bot army was supposed
to wreck OurCoin’s group.

344
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:40,540
He claimed it would overtake
their Telegram!

345
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:44,710
Everyone except him knows
that’s pure fantasy.

346
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:50,450
I wonder if he even believes it himself.
- Why would he pretend at this point?

347
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:52,530
He’s got nothing left to lose.

348
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,140
I’m no longer buying your shit coins.

349
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:58,790
The OurCoin community made a breakthrough!

350
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:02,960
They seized our Telegram channels and reported them.
Now the authorities are banning our sock-puppet accounts!

351
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:07,130
They’re advancing from every angle—
Our offshore funds are getting flagged.

352
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:12,870
Regulators in the west have frozen
our stablecoin reserves and blacklisted withdrawals.

353
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:16,520
If StanCoin hits them with a final rug-pull,
we can still recover, right?

354
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:21,730
Farty Commander…

355
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:24,860
StanCoin…

356
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:29,030
StanCoin didn’t muster enough “degen” to infiltrate.

357
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:32,160
The Telegram infiltration…
never took place.

358
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:54,190
The following tokens remain here:
SolKitty, DogeSwap, PepeInu, and MemeChain.

359
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:14,040
That was an order!
StanCoin’s infiltration was an order!

360
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:18,730
How dare you ignore
my perfect scam blueprint?

361
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:23,420
Is this what we’ve come to?

362
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:30,200
They all lied to me—
the devs, the marketing shills, even the whales.

363
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:35,930
All these influencers are worthless:
No liquidity, no moral backbone.

364
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:38,540
I won’t accept that, we did everything…

365
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:43,750
Cowards, traitors, incompetent con-artists!
- Farty Commander, that’s outrageous!

366
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:47,920
They are the sludge
of the crypto world!

367
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:51,050
No sense of decency whatsoever.

368
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:55,740
They call themselves “pros” because
they spent years forging whitepapers…

369
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:59,390
…but all they really learned
was to steal code on GitHub.

370
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:04,090
For ages, those dreaded regulators
and on-chain detectives blocked my grand plans.

371
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:08,780
Every time, they messed up
just when victory was near.

372
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:12,670
I should have…

373
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:17,890
…liquidated all those worthless top brass,
like LUNA did in May 2022!

374
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:25,220
I never went to any “Crypto Academy.”

375
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:32,000
Yet I still dominated
half the meme-coin market!

376
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,360
Traitors—every one of them.

377
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:43,570
I’ve been double-crossed and hoodwinked
from the very first presale.

378
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:48,790
Such massive betrayal
of our once-glorious scam empire.

379
00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:55,040
But these traitors will pay—
either in prison or monstrous fines!

380
00:41:56,010 --> 00:41:58,100
They’ll drown
in their own compliance forms.

381
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,270
He is bluffing, our scams are not over.

382
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:13,470
All my directives
have been ignored.

383
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:19,210
How can I remain “Farty Commander”
under these circumstances?

384
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:23,070
It’s over.

385
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:30,130
Our grand rug-pull is finished.

386
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:39,810
If you think I’ll simply walk away
from this fiasco…

387
00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:44,500
…you’re mistaken. I’d rather
burn my tokens than surrender.

388
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:51,430
Flood PumpFun and MoonShot
with fancy shit coins!

389
00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:15,920
Farty Commander wouldn’t actually
destroy himself, would he?

390
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:19,050
SolDoge… ButtCoin…

391
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:27,390
Pack your wallets and ledgers. In one hour,
a private jet will whisk you away to a no-extradition paradise.

392
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,970
Everything is lost.

393
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:33,570
Completely lost.

394
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:40,870
You know I’ll stay here with you.
FartyCoin’s scam is all I have left.

395
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:55,280
Farty Commander, I’m staying too.

396
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:20,870
Now what?

397
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:23,480
Time to end this charade.

398
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:28,690
Should we just give up scamming?
Inconceivable!

399
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:34,430
The Farty Commander refuses to surrender.
No more capitulations—no 2022 references, ever!

400
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:36,600
But he doesn’t want to lead anymore.
He literally said:

401
00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:38,600
“Flood PumpFun and MoonShot with fancy shits.”

402
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:42,250
No one can replace him.
He’s the one true master of meme scams.

403
00:44:42,770 --> 00:44:44,850
He’s just confused.
He’ll bounce back.

404
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:48,500
Great. Then what’s the plan?

405
00:44:51,110 --> 00:44:54,240
There’s no real “plan.”
He never intended to lose.

406
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,890
We owe him everything.
- That’s meaningless drivel.

407
00:44:58,410 --> 00:45:00,490
We have to act now,
or we’ll be indicted next.

408
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:04,140
You only care about your own ass!
- Watch your words.

409
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:14,920
Damn it…

410
00:45:19,610 --> 00:45:23,790
We’ll never get out unscathed.
It’s definitely over.

411
00:45:24,310 --> 00:45:25,350
We should wait a bit.

412
00:45:25,870 --> 00:45:29,520
Even the Farty Commander
no longer believes in a comeback.

413
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:34,210
HaukTuah says there’s a hidden network
that tunnels under the new KYC rules.

414
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:37,860
Why did you swear
you’d stay with her?

415
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:42,030
I don’t know.
Honestly.

416
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,250
It’s quiet now.
Let’s go take a walk.
