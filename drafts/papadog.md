To @all $SIMONSCAT holders and believers,

We know recent events have shaken trust. The original devs have gone silent, leaving us in uncertainty. But we refuse to let $SIMONSCAT die! This project is no longer in the hands of those who abandoned it. We are stepping up, taking control, and reviving $SIMONSCAT as a community-driven project.

ðŸ”¹ A New Beginning, A Stronger Future
From now on, $SIMONSCAT belongs to the people. We believe in its potential, and we wonâ€™t give up! This is now a movement led by strong and passionate individuals.  

ðŸ”¹ We Need Your Support â€“ Now More Than Ever!
Your trust and support mean everything. We are ready to fight back for this project. This is just the beginning of a powerful comeback!

ðŸ”¹ Transparency, Trust & True Community Power
Trust isnâ€™t given, itâ€™s earned. We promise full transparency, real communication, and a truly community-driven future. No more silence.
