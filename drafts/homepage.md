## **What is OUR COIN (\$OCN)?**

### Checkout [The White Paper](https://github.com/ourshell/Our-Coin/blob/main/White-Paper.md)

Welcome to **OUR COIN**, a token on the Solana blockchain that hilariously satirizes communist ideals. It’s the most epic political meme coin in our very prestigious history!

Back in the day, it was never “my” or “your” success — always “our” achievements. Now, we’re poking fun at that system with the creation of **\$OCN**. We want to bring humor and a lighthearted look at what it means to “redistribute” value in a crypto-driven world.

We’re building an amazing community on Telegram and Twitter, and we’ll launch once we have enough comrades to support the cause:

## **How to Buy \$OCN**
Here’s how you can join the revolution, comrade. We’ll focus on two popular Solana wallets — **Phantom** and **Solflare**. Feel free to buy SOL using any exchange like **Revolut, Binance, FTX, Coinbase**, etc., then transfer it to your wallet.

> **Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Always keep at least 0.1 SOL in your wallet for transaction fees.**

### **Example**  
If you want to buy 0.2 SOL worth of **\$OCN**, transfer **0.3 SOL** to your wallet (0.2 for buying + 0.1 for fees).

- **Mobile (iOS & Android)**: Download the **Phantom Wallet** app from the official App Store or Google Play.

### **Step 2: Create a Wallet**
Open Phantom and select **“Create New Wallet.”** Follow the prompts to set a password, then carefully note down your secret recovery phrase (never share it with anyone!).

### **Step 3: Deposit SOL into Phantom**  
**Option A: Buy SOL within Phantom**  
Use integrated services like MoonPay or Coinbase Pay. If asked for ID verification (KYC), follow their instructions.

**Option B: Transfer SOL from Another Exchange**  
1. **Copy Your Phantom Address**: Click on your account name in Phantom and copy the wallet address.  
2. **Withdraw from Exchange**: On Revolut, Binance, FTX, or Coinbase, find “Withdraw SOL” and paste your Phantom address.  
3. **Confirm the Withdrawal**: Enter the amount of SOL you wish to send.

Make sure you have **0.1 SOL left** after buying \$OCN.

### **Step 4: Swap SOL for \$OCN**  
1. **Open Phantom** and click on the **“Swap”** tab.  
2. **Select “SOL”** as the token you’re swapping from.  
3. **Paste \$OCN’s Contract Address (TBA)** as the token you’re swapping to (it won’t be listed because it’s new).  
4. **Confirm Your Swap**: Enter the amount of SOL you want to trade, but remember to keep about 0.1 SOL for fees.  
5. **Execute**: Review and confirm. Once it’s done, **\$OCN** will show up in your Phantom wallet.
