If you enjoy creative, satirical tokens and are curious about investing in Solana-based projects, read on!

## **What is OUR COIN (\$OCN)?**  
**OUR COIN** is a brand-new cryptocurrency built on the **Solana** network.

## **How to Buy \$OCN**  
Below, you’ll find step-by-step instructions to guide you through the process of purchasing **\$OCN**. We’ll cover three main approaches:

1. **Phantom Wallet** (a popular Solana wallet).  
2. **Solflare** (another user-friendly Solana wallet).  
3. **Revolut** (a simpler, more universal way to buy SOL directly and then transfer).

Remember: **Always do your own research, and never invest more than you can afford to lose.**

### **Important Note on SOL Requirements**  
To trade **\$OCN**, you will need Solana (SOL) in your wallet. However, **you must keep at least 0.1 SOL** in your wallet to cover transaction and network fees.  
- **Example**: If you plan to invest 0.2 SOL in **\$OCN**, you need an additional 0.1 SOL in your wallet for fees—meaning you should deposit a total of **0.3 SOL**.

## **1. Buying \$OCN via Phantom Wallet**

### **Step 1: Download & Install Phantom**  
- **Desktop (Browser Extension)**: Visit the official [Phantom website](https://phantom.app/) (make sure it’s the legitimate site) and download the extension for Chrome, Brave, Firefox, or Edge.  
- **Mobile (iOS & Android)**: Download the **Phantom Wallet** app from the official App Store or Google Play Store.

### **Step 2: Create or Import a Wallet**  
- **Create New Wallet**: Open Phantom and choose “Create New Wallet.” Follow the on-screen prompts, create a secure password, and back up your secret recovery phrase (never share this phrase with anyone!).  
- **Import Existing Wallet**: If you already have a Solana wallet, you can import it by entering your secret recovery phrase.

### **Step 3: Verify Your Wallet & Identity (If Needed)**  
Phantom itself does not typically require an ID verification. However, if you’re purchasing SOL through a third-party service integrated with Phantom (like MoonPay or Coinbase Pay), you may need to provide identification to comply with KYC (Know Your Customer) regulations.  
- **Provide Required Documents**: Usually, you will need a government-issued ID and possibly proof of address.  
- **Wait for Approval**: Approval can be instant or take a few hours/days depending on the service.

### **Step 4: Deposit SOL into Phantom**  
You can obtain SOL in multiple ways. Two common methods are:  
1. **Buy SOL within Phantom**: Use integrated services like MoonPay or Coinbase Pay to purchase SOL directly. Follow their prompts for payment methods and KYC verification if required.  
2. **Transfer SOL from Another Exchange**: If you already have SOL on an exchange (like Binance, FTX, or Coinbase), withdraw it to your Phantom wallet address.  
   - **Find Your Phantom Address**: Open Phantom, click on your account name at the top, and copy the wallet address.  
   - **Paste It on the Exchange Withdrawal Page**: Enter the amount of SOL you wish to withdraw and confirm.

Make sure to deposit **enough SOL** so that you have at least **0.1 SOL remaining** after your desired investment.

### **Step 5: Swap SOL for \$OCN**  
1. **Open Phantom**: Go to the “Swap” tab.  
2. **Select “SOL” as the token you are swapping from**.  
3. **Select “\$OCN” as the token you are swapping to** (if it’s not listed, you might have to input the contract address—follow our official website or Twitter for the verified contract address).  
4. **Confirm Your Swap**: Enter the amount of SOL you want to trade (remember to leave 0.1 SOL in your wallet).  
5. **Execute Transaction**: Review the transaction details and click “Swap.” Once confirmed, **\$OCN** will appear in your Phantom wallet balance.

## **2. Buying \$OCN via Solflare**

### **Step 1: Download & Install Solflare**  
- **Browser Extension**: Go to the [Solflare official site](https://solflare.com/) and install the extension for your preferred browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).  
- **Mobile App**: Download the Solflare app from the App Store or Google Play.

### **Step 2: Create or Import a Wallet**  
- **Create New Wallet**: Follow the on-screen prompts to set up a brand-new Solflare wallet. Back up your recovery phrase securely.  
- **Import Existing Wallet**: Use your existing Solana seed phrase if you want to merge or transfer from another wallet.

### **Step 3: Verify Your Wallet & Identity (If Needed)**  
Similar to Phantom, Solflare itself does not usually require ID verification for standard usage. You’ll only need verification if you use an integrated exchange or a debit/credit card buy feature within the wallet.

### **Step 4: Deposit SOL into Solflare**  
1. **Buy SOL within Solflare**: Some versions or regions might support direct purchase via MoonPay. If so, complete KYC with the service.  
2. **Transfer SOL from Another Source**: If you already have SOL on an exchange (or another wallet), send it to your **Solflare** wallet address.  
   - **Find Your Address**: Open Solflare, click on “Receive,” and copy your SOL address.  
   - **Withdraw From Exchange**: Paste your SOL address and confirm the withdrawal.  

Again, ensure you deposit enough SOL to cover your intended purchase amount **plus** at least 0.1 SOL for fees.

### **Step 5: Swap SOL for \$OCN**  
1. **Navigate to the Swap Feature**: Inside Solflare, look for “Swap” or “Trade.”  
2. **Select SOL as the input**.  
3. **Choose \$OCN as the output** (or paste the contract address if needed).  
4. **Review the Transaction**: Enter the desired amount and confirm.  
5. **Wait for Confirmation**: Once the transaction is confirmed on the Solana network, you will see **\$OCN** in your Solflare wallet.

## **3. Buying \$OCN via Revolut (A Simpler & Often Cheaper Option)**

Revolut is a popular financial app that often offers lower fees or taxes for buying cryptocurrencies (depending on your region). Here’s how to use Revolut in combination with a Solana wallet like **Phantom** or **Solflare**.

### **Step 1: Download & Sign Up for Revolut**  
1. **Create an Account**: Download the **Revolut** app from the App Store or Google Play.  
2. **Identity Verification**: Revolut requires standard KYC checks. You’ll need to submit a valid ID (passport, driver’s license, or national ID), and possibly a selfie or proof of address.  
3. **Link a Payment Method**: Attach your bank account, debit/credit card, or other supported payment options within Revolut.

### **Step 2: Buy Solana (SOL) on Revolut**  
1. **Navigate to the Crypto Section**: Inside the Revolut app, look for “Crypto” or “Invest.”  
2. **Select Solana (SOL)**: Find Solana on the list and tap “Buy.”  
3. **Choose Your Payment Method**: You can pay using your Revolut balance or linked bank card.  
4. **Enter the Amount**: Decide how much SOL you want to purchase. Remember to account for the 0.1 SOL you must keep for fees if you plan to swap for **\$OCN**.  

*It’s entirely up to you how much SOL you buy—there’s no mandatory 1 SOL minimum. For instance, if you plan to invest 0.2 SOL in \$OCN, buy at least 0.3 SOL to cover that 0.2 investment plus 0.1 in fees.*

### **Step 3: Transfer SOL from Revolut to Your Wallet**  
1. **Get Your Solana Wallet Address**:  
   - **Phantom**: Open Phantom and copy the address from the main screen.  
   - **Solflare**: Open Solflare and tap “Receive” to copy the address.  
2. **Go Back to Revolut**: Find your newly purchased SOL.  
3. **Transfer/Send SOL**: Tap “Withdraw” or “Send,” then paste the wallet address you copied from Phantom or Solflare.  
4. **Confirm Transaction**: Check that the address is correct and confirm.  
5. **Wait for Completion**: Solana transactions are usually quite fast, but it may take a minute or two for the SOL to appear in your wallet.

### **Step 4: Swap SOL for \$OCN in Your Wallet**  
Once the SOL is in your Phantom or Solflare wallet, **follow the Swap instructions** in the relevant wallet section above. Simply choose **\$OCN** as the target token and swap.

## **Additional Tips & Important Information**  
1. **Always Keep 0.1 SOL for Fees**: On Solana, you need a small reserve to pay for network fees.  
2. **Do Not Overinvest**: Cryptocurrencies can be highly volatile. Invest only what you’re willing (and able) to lose.  
3. **Security First**:  
   - Never share your **secret recovery phrase** or **private keys** with anyone.  
   - Enable **2-Factor Authentication** (2FA) where possible.  
   - Use strong passwords and store backups offline.  
4. **Check Contract Addresses**: Only use official contract addresses for **\$OCN** to avoid scams or impostors.  
5. **Stay Informed**: Markets fluctuate, so keep an eye on official announcements, community updates, and your wallet balance.
