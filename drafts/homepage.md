## **What is OUR COIN (\$OCN)?**

Welcome to OUR COIN, token on the Solana blockchain that playfully satirizes the concepts of communism. It's the most epic political meme coin in our very prestigious history.
Back in the day, it was never "my" or "your". It was "our success", "our achievements", our engineers... We are laughing at this system with the creation of OUR COIN! üöÄ
Drawing inspiration from political ideologies, **\$OCN** aims to bring humor and a lighthearted take on what it means to ‚Äúredistribute‚Äù value in a crypto-driven world.

We're building an incredible community on Telegram and Twitter, and we'll launch as soon as we have enough comrades to support the cause.

## **How to Buy \$OCN**
Below, you‚Äôll find step-by-step instructions to guide you through the process of purchasing **\$OCN**. We‚Äôll cover three main approaches:

1. **Phantom Wallet** (a popular Solana wallet), we recommend this one.
2. **Solflare** (another user-friendly Solana wallet).
3. **Revolut** - Simpler and more universal way to buy SOL directly and then transfer).

Remember: **Always do your own research, and never invest more than you can afford to lose.**

### **Important Note on SOL Requirements**
To trade **\$OCN**, you will need Solana (SOL) in your wallet. However, **you must keep at least 0.1 SOL** in your wallet to cover transaction and network fees. It's enough for a hundred transactions.
- **Example**: If you plan to invest 0.2 SOL in **\$OCN**, you need an additional 0.1 SOL in your wallet for fees‚Äîmeaning you should deposit a total of **0.3 SOL**.

## **1. Buying \$OCN via Phantom Wallet**

### **Step 1: Download & Install Phantom**
- **Desktop (Browser Extension)**: Visit the official [Phantom website](https://phantom.app/) (make sure it‚Äôs the legitimate site) and download the extension for Chrome, Firefox, or Edge.

Phantom itself does not typically require an ID verification. However, if you‚Äôre purchasing SOL through a third-party service integrated with Phantom (like MoonPay or Coinbase Pay), you may need to provide identification to comply with KYC (Know Your Customer) regulations.  
- **Provide Required Documents**: Usually, you will need a government-issued ID and possibly proof of address.  
- **Wait for Approval**: Approval can be instant or take a few hours/days depending on the service.

### **Step 4: Deposit SOL into Phantom**  
You can obtain SOL in multiple ways. Two common methods are:  
1. **Buy SOL within Phantom**: Use integrated services like MoonPay or Coinbase Pay to purchase SOL directly. Follow their prompts for payment methods and KYC verification if required.  
2. **Transfer SOL from Another Exchange**: If you already have SOL on an exchange (like Binance, FTX, or Coinbase), withdraw it to your Phantom wallet address.  
   - **Find Your Phantom Address**: Open Phantom, click on your account name at the top, and copy the wallet address.  
   - **Paste It on the Exchange Withdrawal Page**: Enter the amount of SOL you wish to withdraw and confirm.

Make sure to deposit **enough SOL** so that you have at least **0.1 SOL remaining** after your desired investment.

### **Step 5: Swap SOL for \$OCN**
1. **Open Phantom**: Go to the ‚ÄúSwap‚Äù tab.
2. **Select ‚ÄúSOL‚Äù as the token you are swapping from**.

4. **Confirm Your Swap**: Enter the amount of SOL you want to trade. Initially remember to keep about 0.1 SOL in your wallet for precausion. It will be used to cover network fees and taxes.
