## **What is OUR COIN (\$OCN)?**

Welcome to OUR COIN, token on the Solana blockchain that playfully satirizes the concepts of communism. It's the most epic political meme coin in our very prestigious history.
Back in the day, it was never "my" or "your". It was "our success", "our achievements", our engineers... We are laughing at this system with the creation of OUR COIN! üöÄ
Drawing inspiration from political ideologies, **\$OCN** aims to bring humor and a lighthearted take on what it means to ‚Äúredistribute‚Äù value in a crypto-driven world.

We're building an incredible community on Telegram and Twitter, and we'll launch as soon as we have enough comrades to support the cause.

## **How to Buy \$OCN**
Below, you‚Äôll find step-by-step instructions to guide you through the process of purchasing **\$OCN**. We‚Äôll cover two main approaches:

1. **Phantom Wallet** (a popular Solana wallet), we recommend this one.
2. **Solflare** (another user-friendly Solana wallet).

- **Revolut** - Simplest way to buy Solana and transfer to your wallet. Using this option you can bypass ID card verification and other complex stuff for Solana deposit.

Remember: **Always do your own research, and never invest more than you can afford to lose.**

### **Important Note on SOL Requirements**
To trade **\$OCN**, you will need Solana (SOL) in your wallet. However, **you must keep at least 0.1 SOL** in your wallet to cover transaction and network fees. It's enough for a hundred transactions.

**Example**: If you plan to invest 0.2 SOL in **\$OCN**, you need an additional 0.1 SOL in your wallet for fees‚Äîmeaning you should deposit a total of **0.3 SOL**.

*It‚Äôs entirely up to you how much SOL you buy‚Äîthere‚Äôs no mandatory 1 SOL minimum. For instance, if you plan to invest 0.2 SOL in \$OCN, buy at least 0.3 SOL to cover that 0.2 investment plus 0.1 in fees.*

## **1. Buying \$OCN via Phantom Wallet**

### **Step 1: Download & Install Phantom**
- **Desktop (Browser Extension)**: Visit the official [Phantom website](https://phantom.app/) (make sure it‚Äôs the legitimate site) and download the extension for Chrome, Firefox, Edge.
- **Mobile (iOS & Android)**: Download the **Phantom Wallet** app from the official App Store or Google Play Store.

### **Step 2: Create a Wallet**
**Create New Wallet**: Open Phantom and choose ‚ÄúCreate New Wallet.‚Äù Follow the on-screen prompts, create a secure password, and back up your secret recovery phrase (never share this phrase with anyone!).

### **Step 3: Verify Your Wallet & Identity (If Needed)**
You can bypass this step if you have SOL on exchange like Revolut, Binance, FTX, Coinbase, etc. Simply buy 0.3 SOL and transfer them to your Solana wallet address.

Phantom itself does not require an ID verification. If you‚Äôre purchasing SOL through a third-party service integrated with Phantom (like MoonPay or Coinbase Pay), you have to provide identification to comply with KYC regulations.  
- **Provide Required Documents**: Usually, you will need a government-issued ID and possibly proof of address.
- **Wait for Approval**: Approval can be instant or take a few hours/days depending on the service.

### **Step 4: Deposit SOL into Phantom**  
Two common methods are:  
1. **Buy SOL within Phantom**: Use integrated services like MoonPay or Coinbase Pay to purchase SOL directly. Follow their prompts for payment methods and KYC verification if required.  
2. **Transfer SOL from Another Exchange**: If you already have SOL on an exchange, like Revolut, Binance, FTX, or Coinbase, withdraw it to your Phantom wallet address.  
   - **Find Your Phantom Address**: Open Phantom, click on your account name at the top, and copy the wallet address.  
   - **Paste It on the Exchange Withdrawal Page**: Enter the amount of SOL you wish to withdraw and confirm.

Make sure to deposit **enough SOL** so that you have at least **0.1 SOL remaining** after your desired investment.

### **Step 5: Swap SOL for \$OCN**
1. **Open Phantom**: Go to the ‚ÄúSwap‚Äù tab.
2. **Select ‚ÄúSOL‚Äù as the token you are swapping from**.
3. **Paste above <TBA> adress of ‚Äú\$OCN‚Äù as the token you are swapping to** I will not be listed because it's quite new. That's why you are proving the swapping the contract address.
4. **Confirm Your Swap**: Enter the amount of SOL you want to trade. Initially remember to keep about 0.1 SOL in your wallet for precausion. It will be used to cover network fees and taxes.
5. **Execute Transaction**: Review the transaction details and click ‚ÄúSwap.‚Äù Once confirmed, **\$OCN** will appear in your Phantom wallet balance.

**Create New Wallet**: Follow the on-screen prompts to set up a brand-new Solflare wallet. Back up your recovery phrase securely.  

### **Step 3: Verify Your Wallet & Identity (If Needed)**  
Similar to Phantom, Solflare itself does not usually require ID verification for standard usage. You‚Äôll only need verification if you use an integrated exchange or a debit/credit card buy feature within the wallet.

### **Step 4: Deposit SOL into Solflare**  
1. **Buy SOL within Solflare**: Some versions or regions might support direct purchase via MoonPay. If so, complete KYC with the service.  
2. **Transfer SOL from Another Source**: If you already have SOL on an exchange (or another wallet), send it to your **Solflare** wallet address.  
   - **Find Your Address**: Open Solflare, click on ‚ÄúReceive,‚Äù and copy your SOL address.  
   - **Withdraw From Exchange**: Paste your SOL address and confirm the withdrawal.  

Again, ensure you deposit enough SOL to cover your intended purchase amount **plus** at least 0.1 SOL for fees.

### **Step 5: Swap SOL for \$OCN**  
1. **Navigate to the Swap Feature**: Inside Solflare, look for ‚ÄúSwap‚Äù or ‚ÄúTrade.‚Äù  
2. **Select SOL as the input**.  
3. **Choose \$OCN as the output** (or paste the contract address if needed).  
4. **Review the Transaction**: Enter the desired amount and confirm.  
5. **Wait for Confirmation**: Once the transaction is confirmed on the Solana network, you will see **\$OCN** in your Solflare wallet.

## **Additional Tips & Important Information**
1. **Always Keep 0.1 SOL for Fees**: On Solana, you need a small reserve to pay for network fees.
2. **Do Not Overinvest**: Cryptocurrencies can be highly volatile. Invest only what you‚Äôre willing (and able) to lose.
3. **Security First**:
   - Never share your **secret recovery phrase** or **private keys** with anyone.
   - Enable **2-Factor Authentication** (2FA) where possible.
   - Use strong passwords and store backups offline.
4. **Check Contract Addresses**: Only use official contract addresses for **\$OCN** to avoid scams or impostors.
5. **Stay Informed**: Markets fluctuate, so keep an eye on official announcements, community updates, and your wallet balance.
