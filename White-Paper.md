# **OUR COIN: The White Paper**

---

### **1. Introduction**
OUR COIN is a unique cryptocurrency that mixes humor, technology, and cultural satire. Inspired by jokes and parodies of communism, OUR COIN is all about shared effort and equal participation. It’s not just a cryptocurrency; it’s a fun way to express creativity and bring people together.

### **2. The Origin Story**
OUR COIN started as a joke on Facebook called "OurSQL," a funny communist parody featuring the hammer and sickle and Bugs Bunny worshipping the collective ideal. In Eastern Europe, we often use humor to make fun of the communist past. From satirical posters to underground clubs decorated with rusty propaganda plates, there’s a rich tradition of laughing at history.

For example, old signs once found in coal mines said things like, "All proud communists together underground" — a literal translation from Cyrillic. Inspired by these jokes, I created a GitHub space called "OurShell" because I write scripts in PowerShell. Then, I decided to tokenize the idea and created OUR COIN.

This project celebrates the funny side of "no my, only our" and brings it to the digital age with a playful twist.
